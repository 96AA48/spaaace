## Spááácè - My first "real" game/ good ol' space shooter

This is the first game I ever made/finished, please excuse the commitlog, lots of changes without descriptive commits are my specialty on this project.
I started this to test out HaxePunk and it more or less grew into a game.

Thank you for taking a look!
